**Create an Azure Account**

**Introduction**

This section will guide you through the process of creating a Microsoft Azure account. An Azure account allows you to manage Azure services and subscriptions. If you are a new user, you can sign up for a free account which includes a number of free services for 12 months.

**Prerequisites**

- A valid phone number
- A credit card (for identity verification purposes)
- A Microsoft account or a GitHub account (if you don't have a Microsoft account, the process will guide you to create one)

**Steps to Create an Azure Account**

**Step 1: Visit the Azure Portal**

- Open your web browser.
- Navigate to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
- Click on **Start free**.

**Step 2: Microsoft Account Sign In or Sign Up**

- If you already have a Microsoft account, enter your email, phone number, or Skype ID, then click **Next** and enter your password to sign in.
- If you do not have a Microsoft account, click on **Create one!** Follow the prompts to set up a new Microsoft account.

**Step 3: Verify Identity**

- After signing in, you will be prompted to verify your identity.
- Choose to receive a verification code either via phone call or SMS.
- Enter the code you receive on the verification screen.

**Step 4: Agreement and Setup**

- You will be asked to provide additional details such as your credit card information for identity verification. Your card will not be charged unless you upgrade to a pay-as-you-go account.
- Agree to the subscription agreement, offer details, and privacy statement.
- Click **Sign up** to complete the process.

**Step 5: Welcome to Azure**

- Once your account is created, you will be redirected to the Azure dashboard.
- You can now start exploring Azure services and set up new resources.

**Conclusion**

Congratulations! You now have an Azure account. You can begin creating and managing Azure resources. Stay tuned for the next section of the tutorial, where we will discuss setting up a resource group and a storage account.
