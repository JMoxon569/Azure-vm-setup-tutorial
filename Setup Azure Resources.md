**Setup Azure Resources**

**Introduction**

In this section, we will walk through the process of setting up essential Azure resources. We'll create a resource group and a storage account, which are foundational elements for organizing and managing your Azure services.

**Prerequisites**

- An active Azure account.
- Successfully logged into the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

**Steps to Set Up Azure Resources**

**Step 1: Create a Resource Group**

A resource group is a container that holds related resources for an Azure solution. The resource group includes those resources that you want to manage as a group.

**Navigation**

- From the Azure portal's home screen, search for and select **Resource groups**.
- Click on **+ Create**, to start the process of creating a new resource group.

**Configuration**

- **Subscription**: Select your Azure subscription in which to create the resource group.
- **Resource group**: Enter a name for your new resource group. Choose a name that reflects the purpose of the resources you'll be adding to this group.
- **Region**: Select the geographic region where the resource group will be located. This should be close to where the services will be used.

**Create**

- Review the settings and then click **Review + create**.
- After the validation passes, click **Create**.

**Step 2: Create a Storage Account**

Azure Storage Accounts provide a unique namespace for your Azure Storage data, accessible from anywhere in the world over HTTP or HTTPS.

**Navigation**

- From the Azure portal's home screen, search for and select **Storage accounts**.
- Click on **+ Create** to initiate the creation of a new storage account.

**Configuration**

- **Subscription**: Ensure the correct subscription is selected.
- **Resource group**: Choose the resource group you created earlier.
- **Storage account name**: Enter a unique name for your storage account.
- **Location**: Choose the same region as your resource group to minimize latency and costs.
- **Performance**: Select between Standard and Premium, depending on your needs.
- **Account kind**: Choose the type of storage account to create (e.g., BlobStorage, StorageV2, etc.).
- **Replication**: Select the level of data replication that suits your durability and availability needs.

**Create**

- Review your settings and click **Review + create**.
- After the validation is successful, click **Create**.

**Conclusion**

You have now successfully set up a resource group and a storage account in Azure. These resources will help you organize and manage other services and applications you might deploy in Azure.
